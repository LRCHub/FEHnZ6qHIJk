[00:00.76] Playas always trying to pop bottles
[00:04.07] Niggas love to pop bottles then get you a table my nigga

[00:20.95] Wake up (drank)
[00:22.69] Faded (drank)
[00:24.32] Faded (drank)
[00:30.82] 
[00:26.58] No syrup in this cup but this that po' up
[00:29.23] When you see me po' up, turn up til you throw up
[00:32.39] Like a bulemic fiending, for hurl over them toilets
[00:35.46] If I run out of liquor in your city, yo where the store at?
[01:04.96] 
[00:38.73] One bottle, two bottles I'm a soldier, never sober
[00:42.77] Cup runneth over, don't give a fuck about cirrhosis
[00:45.27] One life, that's all we have, okay, let's toast to that
[00:48.55] Then dive in a pool full of liquor
[00:50.56] Swim laps like Michael Phelps
[01:05.06] 
[00:51.56] Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
[00:54.65] I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
[00:57.26] First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
[01:01.42] Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
[01:04.79] I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
[01:07.74] All the girls wanna play Baywatch
[01:10.35] I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
[01:14.44] Pool full of liquor I'ma dive in it
[01:31.94]

[01:35.62] 
[01:30.83] Used to wake up every morning to a glass of Alize
[01:34.12] Hope this dollar shot of E&J will take the pain away
[01:37.21] Aim and shoot, shots of Ciroc will make the girls get loose
[01:40.59] With it we all trippin' off the hen like a female chicken
[01:43.81] You with it? (Soulo)
[01:53.81] 
[01:44.73] Spread your wings, you probably won't get far
[01:47.27] I honestly wouldn't advise operating a car (nah)
[01:50.75] Try not to let the peer pressure get the best of ya
[01:53.62] And end up giving it up in a restroom like the rest of us
[02:22.12] 
[01:56.62] Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
[01:59.58] I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
[02:02.29] First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
[02:06.20] Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

[02:37.09] Known for popping them bottles
[02:38.19] Under my pants be a golden dick
[02:39.74] Bitch, everything about me solid
[02:41.46] Burberry nigga, them be my draws
[02:42.90] Alexander McQueen in closets

[02:50.17] Twisting off them molly caps
[02:51.60] Ciroc too don't fuck with Goose
[02:53.25] Can I get a shot, swim in your juice
[02:54.94] Worth a stack a minute, everyday that shit repeat
[02:57.95] I ain't tryna sweep you off your feet
[02:59.37] Bitch did you see your tab receipt?
[03:16.87] 
[03:00.97] Nigga why you babysittin' only two or three shots?

[03:46.96] (Pull full of liquor dive, in-in...)
[03:53.21] (Wa-watch 'em all flock)
[03:55.69] Aw man (Sherane), where is she taking me?
[04:02.93] Where is she taking me?
[04:14.43] 
[04:05.12] All I, all I, all I, all I
[04:06.67] All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
[04:09.42] And I got hunger pain that grow insane
[04:11.33] Tell me do that sound familiar?
[04:12.44] If it do then you're like me
[04:14.03] Making excuse that your relief
[04:15.69] Is in the bottom of the bottle
[04:17.39] And the greenest indo leaf
[04:30.39] 
[04:18.89] As the window open I release
[04:20.46] Everything that corrode inside of me
[04:22.26] I see you joking, why you laugh?
[04:23.83] Don't you feel bad?
[04:24.74] I probably sleep, and never ever wake up
[04:26.84] Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
[04:28.92] In God I trust
[04:30.08] But just when I thought I had enough
[04:48.08] 
[04:32.48] More, more, bless me more
[04:35.20] We gon' drink this motherfucker down, more
[04:38.74] Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
[04:41.91] Fill it up more, not enough, more
[04:47.27] Bless me more
[04:48.56] We gon' drink this motherfucker down, more
[04:51.87] Bottoms up then we pass it round, more
[04:55.07] Fill it up more, not enough, more
[05:01.53] Fill it up more, not enough, more
[05:08.10] Fill it up more, not enough, more
